## What is Vanta? / FAQs

- **Add 3D animated digital art to any webpage with just a few lines of code.**
- Think of it as wrapper around a digital artwork that allows it to be inserted into an HTML element as a background.
- Effects can interact with mouse/touch inputs.
- Effect parameters (e.g. color) can be easily modified to match your brand.
- Effects are powered by [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) (using WebGL) or [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).
- Total additional filesize is ~120kb minified and gzipped (mostly three.js), which is smaller than comparable background images/videos.
- Vanta includes many pre-defined effects to try out. *More effects will be added soon!*

## More options:

```js
VANTA.WAVES({
  el: '#my-background', // element id or DOM object reference
  color: 0x000000,
  waveHeight: 20,
  shininess: 50,
  waveSpeed: 1.5,
  zoom: 0.75
})
```

Each effect has different parameters. Explore them all!

## Cleanup:

```js
var effect = VANTA.WAVES('#my-background')
effect.destroy() // e.g. call this in React's componentWillUnmount
```

## Usage with React Hooks (requires React 16.8): 

Import `vanta.xxxxx.min.js` as follows. Make sure `three.js` or `p5.js` is also included.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
import * as THREE from './three.min.js'
import BIRDS from './vanta.birds.min.js'

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const [vantaEffect, setVantaEffect] = useState(0)
  const myRef = useRef(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!vantaEffect) {
      setVantaEffect(BIRDS({
        el: myRef.current
      }))
    }
    return () => { 
      if (vantaEffect) vantaEffect.destroy()
    }
  }, [vantaEffect])
  return <div ref={myRef}>
    Foreground content goes here
  </div>
}
```

## Usage with React Classes:

```js
import React from 'react'
import * as THREE from './three.min.js'
import BIRDS from './vanta.birds.min.js'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.myRef = React.createRef()
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.effect = BIRDS({
      el: this.myRef.current
    })
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.effect) this.effect.destroy()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef}>
      Foreground content goes here
    </div>
  }
}
```
